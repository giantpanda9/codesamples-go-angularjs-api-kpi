1. Go AngularJS API in file
2. Video Screencast of the application: https://youtu.be/Q_bTEl7KuII
# Purpose
To demonstrate ability to work with AngularJS - Golang part is simply to host a small server
# Notes
This AngularJS application created under following assumtions:
1) It needs to see how do I work with API using any front-end framework, so, authentication is skipped to speed the development
2) I was instructed that the test would require me to parse JSON from file, not from database
3) I can use my own design implementation - so design inspired by US PC commercials from later 80s and early 90s
4) On bar diagram red-clored bars represent current value, blue-colored maxValue
